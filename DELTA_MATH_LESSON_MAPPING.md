# Delta Math Lesson Mapping for App Math Goals

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use Standards-Based Mapping Instead

**For the easiest and most accurate matching, use the standards-based approach:**

👉 **See `DELTA_MATH_STANDARDS_MAPPING.md`** - This document maps Common Core standards directly to Delta Math lessons.

**Why Standards-Based is Better:**
- Delta Math organizes lessons by Common Core standards
- Each goal already has a standard (e.g., `6.EE.7`)
- Simply search Delta Math for the standard code
- More precise and faster than topic-based searching

---

## Overview
This document maps the math goals used in the app to corresponding Delta Math lessons. Delta Math offers comprehensive math instruction aligned with Common Core standards, making it an excellent supplement for students working on IEP goals.

**Note**: Delta Math's complete lesson list is not publicly accessible via API. This mapping is based on:
- The math goal templates in the app
- Delta Math's known curriculum coverage
- Common Core standard alignments

**Recommended Approach:** Use `DELTA_MATH_STANDARDS_MAPPING.md` for standards-based searching, or use this document for topic-based reference.
