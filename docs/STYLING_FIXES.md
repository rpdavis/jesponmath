# CSS Styling Fixes Applied

## üé® **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **1. Layout Conflicts**
**Problem:** The default Vue CSS (`src/assets/main.css`) was applying conflicting grid layouts and centering that broke the app layout.

**Fixed:**
- Removed conflicting grid layout from `main.css`
- Updated `#app` to use flexbox with proper width/height
- Removed centering that interfered with navigation

### **2. App Container Structure**
**Problem:** The main app container wasn't properly structured for a web application.

**Fixed:**
- Changed `#app` to use `display: flex; flex-direction: column`
- Set proper `width: 100%` and `min-height: 100vh`
- Added consistent background gradient

### **3. Content Area Layout**
**Problem:** Main content and game content areas had sizing and positioning issues.

**Fixed:**
- `.main-content`: Added `flex: 1` for proper expansion, max-width constraint, centered layout
- `.game-content`: Full-width layout for games with proper flex structure
- Better responsive padding and margins

### **4. Title Screen Responsiveness**
**Problem:** Title screen wasn't properly responsive and had layout issues.

**Fixed:**
- Updated container to use proper width/height calculations
- Improved grid layout for game cards (320px minimum instead of 380px)
- Better responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
