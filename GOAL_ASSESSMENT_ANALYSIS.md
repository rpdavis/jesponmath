## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Math goals are mostly APP-SUITABLE** - The majority can be assessed digitally
2. **ELA goals are split** - Reading comprehension with multiple choice can be digital, but writing and oral reading require paper
3. **Writing goals ALL require paper** - No writing goals can be fully assessed digitally
4. **Behavior/Executive Functioning goals ALL require paper** - Need observation and tracking
5. **Phonics/Oral Reading goals ALL require paper** - Need running records and teacher observation

### Template System Design Considerations:

1. **Include assessment method field** in templates:
   - `assessmentMethod: 'app' | 'paper' | 'hybrid'`
   - Helps teachers know how to assess

2. **For APP-SUITABLE templates:**
   - Can auto-generate questions
   - Can auto-grade
   - Can track progress automatically

3. **For PAPER-REQUIRED templates:**
   - Can provide rubric templates
   - Can provide assessment forms
   - Can track manual scores entered by teachers
   - Cannot auto-generate questions (but can provide question prompts/examples)

4. **For HYBRID templates:**
   - Can generate digital questions
   - May need paper component for work samples
   - Can combine both assessment types
