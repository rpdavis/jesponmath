CONSOL_001,Solving Multi-Step Linear Equations,Mikah Villagomez; Dylan Hoffman; Josue Gabriel Moreno; Victor Renteria Cabrera,723735769; 723722666; 723722437; 723722866,math / expressions and equations,4,"Student demonstrates emerging understanding of basic fraction concepts and can add negative integers with support, but has not yet demonstrated understanding of solving single-step or two-step equations with rational coefficients.","by [DATE], given a single variable, two-step linear equation with rational coefficients, student will solve for the variable by using properties of operations (e.g., distributive property, inverse properties), for (4 out of 5) equations, on (2 out of 3) progress monitoring assessments."
CONSOL_002,Multi-Digit Decimal Division,Mikah Villagomez,723735769,math,1,Student demonstrated an ability to add and subtract multi-digit decimal and two digit whole numbers with 100% accuracy 5/5. Student was not able to solve division problems with two-digit decimal and a one- or two-digit whole number (0/5).,"by 9/15/26, when given 10 division equation involving a two-digit decimal and a one- or two-digit whole number (e.g., 20.66/10), along with a worked example, student will accurately solve the problem using a fluent computation strategy, achieving at least 80% accuracy in 4 out of 5 trials, as measured by student work samples and progress monitoring assessments."
CONSOL_003,Multi-Digit Decimal Multiplication,Mikah Villagomez,723735769,math,1,Student demonstrated an ability to add and subtract multi-digit decimal and two digit whole numbers with 100% accuracy 5/5. Student was not able to solve multiplication problems with two-digit decimal and a one- or two-digit whole number (0/5).,"by 9/15/26, when given 10 multiplication equation involving a two-digit decimal and a one- or two-digit whole number (e.g., 20.66 × 10), along with a worked example, student will accurately solve the problem using a fluent computation strategy, achieving at least 80% accuracy in 4 out of 5 trials, as measured by student work samples and progress monitoring assessments."
