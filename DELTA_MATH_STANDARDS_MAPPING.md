# Delta Math Standards-Based Lesson Mapping

## Overview
This document maps **Common Core Math Standards** from your app's goals to **Delta Math lessons**. Delta Math organizes lessons by Common Core standards, making this the most efficient way to find matching lessons.

**How to Use:**
1. Find the standard for a student's goal (e.g., `6.EE.7`)
2. Search Delta Math for that exact standard
3. Assign the corresponding Delta Math lesson(s)
